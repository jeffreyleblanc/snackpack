# TODO

* [ ] make ls also list mounted items and tag if one of the configs has a mounted item
* [ ] enable a config file to have multiple mounts it can use
* [ ] make a `build-config` command that will generate a config file scaffold

---

Low priorities but:

* [ ] make a log in .config/snackpack/backup of all the backups, and flags with timestamp
* [ ] maybe try --progress and/or --partial on the rsync? however these might be updating specific lines...
* [ ] test interruption

More likely we should think about encrypted remote backups over ssh?
