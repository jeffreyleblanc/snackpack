# TODO

* [ ] make ls also list mounted items and tag if one of the configs has a mounted item
* [ ] Make snackpack match whatever source configs there are to the device mounted, and if one match, can run

Low priorities but:

* [ ] make a log in .jlocal/backup of all the backups, and flags with timestamp
* [ ] maybe try --progress and/or --partial on the rsync? however these might be updating specific lines...
* [ ] test interruption

More likely we should think about encrypted remote backups over ssh?
